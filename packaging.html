            <p class="pack info"  data-aos="fade-up">As the world got affected by Covid19, the need for covid testing arose 
                enormously across the globe. Considering the fact that the RTPCR tests gave the results in 
                couple of days, there started the development of Rapid Antigen (RAT) Covid testing kits. 
                A rapid antigen test is a quick home test to check if you may have COVID-19 and provides 
                a result within 15 to 30 minutes with good accuracy. 

                <br>As the demand for the RATs was huge, the production also had to be up to the mark. 
                We augmented the packaging line process for an India’s leading Biotech Brand which eventually
                resulted in boosting their production metrics and catering to the needs of the market more efficiently.

                <p class="info">In the production line of the RAT kits, once all the individual components 
                    of the kit are filled in the pouch, the kits were used to be sealed and packed in the boxes. 
                    The production throughput number of kits dispatched was calculated by various techniques and 
                    approximation methods. weight approximation of the boxes and the individual kit. There wasn’t 
                    a system in place which could give the exact count of the kits produced without increasing the 
                    lead time. As the production touched heights during the peak Covid phase, there arose some inconsistency 
                    discrepancies in the calculated number of kits as the method was not 100% accurate. effective. 

                    <br>There was a need of a robust solution in place, which could count the kits without any errors, being fast at the same time, catering to the pace of the production.

                <p class="info" >     
                    To deal with this situation, Roborise proposed a solution that automates the batch counting 
                    process by implementing a conveying system integrated with an automatic counting system. The 
                    counting conveyors were set up in the packaging line. Now, once the pouches were sealed, they 
                    were passed over the fast-moving conveyers where they were being counted before being packed. 
                    The system had a throughput of 83 kits/min which eventually resulted in a total counting of around 
                    1,00,000 kits per day, which comfortably catered to the total kits production per day. The conveyor 
                    can be automatically stopped by setting a preset limit on the control box based on the batch quantity, 
                    also it indicates the number of batches produced. A separate counter device unit was also developed which
                     can be attached to the existing conventional conveying systems.

                    <br>The counting automation not only eliminated the human errors which can be prominently seen in the 
                    previously used calculation techniques manual weighing process but also saved a lot of lead time 
                    before the dispatch. This led to an increased daily capacity of the company for packaging and 
                    delivering the RAT kits out in the nation at the earliest possible.
