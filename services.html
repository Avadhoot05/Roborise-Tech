                <p class="info">FMCG is a demanding industry with a wide variety of types and sizes of goods. Growing populations, changing cultures, rising per capita, disposable incomes, as well as a growing rural request, are the crucial drivers of this industry. The factors that make FMCG indeed more demanding are its varied storage formats and speedy operations. Numerous options and flexibility to choose from, are making consumers unpredictable each day. The fast availability of your product can earn you consumers' loyalty. To achieve it, the need of the hour is to first control the high volumes, manage the changing demands from your consumers, the time taken to reach millions of stores, and keep stocks optimal. Non-Food FMCG frequently carries shorter shelf lives and owes low-profit margins; but because of the bulk sales, they happen to be genuinely profitable. Companies in this sector conduct businesses at high volumes which results in vast distribution networks, low- contribution approaches, and high stock turnovers. The necessity for automation arises majorly in material handling and warehousing systems.</p>
